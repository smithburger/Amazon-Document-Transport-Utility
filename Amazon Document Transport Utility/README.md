# Amazon Document Transport Utility

This is being developed as an almost drop in replacement for the Amazon Merchant Transport Utility. The AMTU is being depreciated with Amazon MWS. This new utility (ADTU) will use the new SP-API as mandated by Amazon.

The ADTU uses the [Amazon-SP-API-CSharp](https://github.com/abuzuhri/Amazon-SP-API-CSharp) library written by [abuzuhri](https://github.com/abuzuhri).
